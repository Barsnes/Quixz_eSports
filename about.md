In 2015, Tobias Barsnes created Quixz eSports. It started small with the goal of becoming a full norwegian Counter Strike team. They played several seasons in Telenorligaen, but the roster kept changing. In 2016 Quixz attended their first Lan event, and it ended with a 7-12th place. In the first quarter of 2017, the players decided to split, as they did not have the motivation to keep playing together.
