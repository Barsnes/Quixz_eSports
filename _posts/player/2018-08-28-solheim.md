  Joakim Solheim is the Rocket League 1v1 player for Quixz eSports. He started
  playing the game several years ago, and is now trying his best to become a
  world star player.


  Located in Norway, he has a good connection to the world around him, and is
  actively playing the game to advance his skillset. When we signed him, he told
  us that he did not have any set goal, but he wanted to get better, and that he
  is a person with good dedication.


  Currently he is studying in Norway, at the age of 17. He is not yet sure of
  what the future will bring him, but that whatever the future brings, he will
  be prepared.
