Quixz eSports is an organization located in Norway. We started as a group of friends in 2014, and have grown bigger with time. Our goal is to make the esports scene better for everyone, and that players can have someone to have their back.

Currently we are looking for teams and players in various games, and hope to grow big. We live in a time when the community is growing everyday, and we hope to help the growth.
