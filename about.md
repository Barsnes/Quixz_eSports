In 2015, Tobias Barsnes created Quixz eSports. It started small with the goal of becoming a full norwegian Counter Strike team. They played several seasons in Telenorligaen, but the roster kept changing. In 2016 Quixz attended their first Lan event, and it ended with a 7-12th place. In the first quarter of 2017, the players decided to split, as they did not have the motivation to keep playing together.

Quixz has never had a lot of money, and has therefore relied on dedication from everyone. The founder, Tobias Barsnes, has always been a big asset to Quixz eSports. He has created all graphics, content and funded some expenses. GoldBananaMaster, Wave, Rednaz and Mirx, are other individuals who helped getting Quixz to where it is today.
